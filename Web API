1) What is content negotiation in ASP.Net Web API?
Answer
By default Api send the api responce in JSON format if we didnt set any accept header.
The client should be decide the format of the responce they want from the server. ex. responce from server be like XML, JSON etc.
Using "Accept" header, client can specify the responce which he wants.
  Accept: application/json
  Accept: application/xml
  
  we can also set the multiple value in accept header and the api select 1st formatter 
      ex: Accept: application/json,application/xml
  
  in responce, server send the value in json or xml form depending on the accept header of request. Also it sends format type in the responce Content-Type header
  Content-Type : application/json
  Content-Type : application/xml
  
  We can also set the quality factor in Accept header, so whose quality factor is greater that other server will pick that one.
      ex: Accept: application/json;q=0.5,application/xml;q=0.8
  so in this case response is in xml format because xml having greater quality factor 
  


2) Explain media type formatters.
Answer
Whenever request comes to server, it looks the accept header and depending on the format which the client has requested the Web API will choose the appropriate formatter for formatting the data.
In web API, media type formatters are classes that are responsible for serialization data.
Here, serialization generally means a process of translating data into a format that can be transmitted and reconstructed later.  
Because of serializing request/response data, Web API can understand request data format in a better way and send data in a format that the client expects. 
It simply specifies data that is being transferred among client and server in HTTP response or request. 

Media Type Formatter Class	MIME Type	Description
JsonMediaTypeFormatter --	application/json, text/json	(Handles JSON format)
XmlMediaTypeFormatter --	application/xml, text/xml	(Handles XML format)
FormUrlEncodedMediaTypeFormatter --	application/x-www-form-urlencoded (Handles HTM form URL-encoded data)
JQueryMvcFormUrlEncodedFormatter --	application/x-www-form-urlencoded	 (Handles model-bound HTML form URL-encoded data)

when the request ie made without the Accep header then by default it send's the data in JSON format
When a request made from the browser, the result always comes in xml format because it passes the header as Accept: text/html
