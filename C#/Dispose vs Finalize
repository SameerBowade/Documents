Dispose
Garbage collector is responsible for releasing the memory (objects) that is not being used by the application. 
But GC has limitation that, it can reclaim or release only memory which is used by managed resources. 
There are a couple of resources which GC is not able to release as it doesn't have information that, how to claim memory from those resources like File handlers, 
window handlers, network sockets, database connections etc. 
If your application is having these resources than its programmerâ€™s responsibility to release unmanaged resources. 
For example, if we open a file in our program and not closed it after processing than that file will not be available for other operation or 
it is being used by other application than they cannot open or modify that file. For this purpose, FileStream class provides Dispose method. 
We must call this method after file processing finished. Otherwise, it will through exception Access Denied or file is being used by other program.
