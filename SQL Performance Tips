1) SET NOCOUNT ON
    Always use SET NOCOUNT ON in every query or Procedure. This will block the count of affected rows so improves the performance in large amount of fetching the data.
    This will improve the procedure execution duration time as well also improve the cPU utilization time.

2) 
    If we have an index on FirstName and LastName column of table then in where clause
      condition 1: It took More Time as well as it also using "Index Scan" to give the result and Logical read is also double
        Where FirstName + ' ' + LastName = 'Sameer Bowade'
        
       Condition 2: It took Less Time as well as it also using "Index Seek" to give the result and Logical read is very less
          Where FirstName = SUBSTRING(@Name , 1, CharIndex(' ',@Name)-1)
                And LastName = SUBSTRING(@Name , 1, CharIndex(' ',@Name)+1, LEN(@Name))
